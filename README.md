**Repository Title: COVID-19 Data Analysis and Happiness Factors**

**Description:**

This repository contains a data analysis project using Python and Jupyter Notebook, focused on exploring the relationship between COVID-19 infection rates and worldwide happiness factors. Two primary datasets were used:

COVID-19 Dataset: This dataset provides daily information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in various countries. The main objective was to find the maximum infection rate in each country on a daily basis.

Worldwide Happiness Report Dataset: This dataset includes information on happiness factors, such as GDP per capita, social support, health life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices, for countries worldwide.

**Project Highlights:**

Max Infection Rate Analysis: The project involves calculating the maximum daily infection rate in each country based on the COVID-19 dataset. This information is crucial in understanding the severity and spread of the virus.

Correlation Analysis: We explore the relationship between the maximum infection rate and various happiness factors from the worldwide happiness report. Correlation analysis helps us understand how factors like GDP, social support, health life expectancy, and freedom impact the infection rate.

Data Visualization: The findings are presented visually using scatterplots and regression plots, allowing for a clear understanding of the relationships.

**Key Insights:**

One of the key findings of this analysis is that developed countries tend to have a higher correlation between their happiness factors and the maximum infection rate. In other words, the study suggests that developed countries are more prone to infection, and we provide visual evidence to support this observation.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook and code to gain deeper insights into the analysis. The project provides a valuable perspective on the interplay between public health and happiness factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.
